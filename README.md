# Rusty-PBBS: A replica of PBBS in Rust.

Rusty-PBBS is a benchmark suite of regular and irregular parallelism in Rust,
introduced at SPAA'23.
We invested substantial effort into developing this codebase,
and we kindly request that you acknowledge our work
by citing our paper when using this code for your own research:

# Build

## Install Rust (cargo, rustc, ...)

```bash
# download and install the version management tool: Rustup
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# confiqure the current shell
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

The `default` features are enough for benchmarking.
If you want to do more hacking, the `complete` profile could help.

## Download rusty-pbbs

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcj-group/rusty-pbbs.git
cd rusty-pbbs/
```

### install gcc if you don't have it on your system.

## Compile benchmarks

```bash
cargo build --release                # compile all benchmarks
cargo build --release --bin="dedup"  # compile an specific benchmark (dedup)
```

# Run
Cargo can run an individual benchmark (e.g. dedup):
```bash
cargo run --release --bin=dedup -- <input_file>
```
or the binary can be run itself:
```bash
/path/to/build/directory/pbbs/release/dedup <input_file>
```

To get the full list of flags and arguments use `--help`:
```bash
/path/to/build/directory/pbbs/release/dedup --help
```

## Example

Run parallel dedup for 3 rounds on an input.
```bash
$ /.../dedup -o outfile -a parhash -r 3 /path/to/input

dedup:	2.560179
dedup:	2.608721
dedup:	2.492258
OutLoopTime:total:	7.966530
2.578050534s
```
